My name is Ruhiddin Turdaliyev, born on 28 June 2003 in the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan. I grew up as a Kyrgyz native, bilingual in Uzbek, and gradually reached an English level around B2. My early education took place at local school No. 59 in the Fergana District, where I felt confident, even strong, compared to my classmates. But that confidence would be challenged soon.

After the 9th grade, I was accepted into the Academic Lyceum under TUIT Fergana branch, specializing in the technicians direction with a focus on math and physics. The moment I entered, I realized something painful: everything I knew was shallow compared to the competition-level students around me. They had deep foundations, while I was suddenly the one who knew nothing at all.

The first year was harsh. My results were the worst in the entire lyceum. At one point, the administration called my parent to the director’s office to warn that I would either improve immediately or be removed from the institution. I returned home only once a week, carrying the pressure of catching up to a world I had never imagined. Yet, in that difficult environment, I found loyal roommates and friends who stood with me, helped me understand subjects, and kept me from breaking under the weight.

Those two years (2019–2021) became a period of rebuilding myself from scratch. Day by day, topic by topic, I wrestled with math and physics until I almost reached the level of the best students in my class. By the end, I discovered that I loved physics more deeply than math. The lyceum awarded me a certificate as a “Technical Programmer,” a small reminder of how far I had climbed.

When the national exam came, I scored 152.25 out of 189 and submitted five choices for university:

1. Mathematics (NUU),  
    2–5. Mathematics & Informatics in various universities.
    

I chose the “Sirtqi” (part-time) format intentionally so I could study independently alongside university. I had wanted IT at TUIT, but fear of failure made me choose safer directions. Ironically, I did not expect to be accepted into my first choice at NUU in Pure Mathematics, yet that is where I landed, according to the rules that assign applicants to the highest successful option.

While studying in Tashkent, I spent my free time in Fergana continuing self-study. My parents supported me once again, buying me a laptop in December 2021 so I could learn IT seriously. In truth, my interests had long been drifting toward electronics, robotics, and automation, but these fields felt too young in Uzbekistan, with limited resources and weak education. So I began with something more accessible: web development.

I started with frontend. I learned HTML with heavy exhaustion, tried building a decent-looking website, only to feel that the time I spent had been wasted. Then I discovered CSS through Uzbek tutorials, practiced small pages, and slowly got better. But a realization struck: frontend felt shallow to me, too focused on design, not enough logic. I wanted depth, structure, reasoning. I wanted backend.

I began learning Java for its security, but I didn’t like the syntax and remembered seeing a more elegant language somewhere. So I turned to Python. I bought Python Basic and Python Advanced courses from PDP Academy for about $130. After completing them, I looked into the next modules, but the high cost and the one-year access limit discouraged me. I began searching for alternatives and found that the same-level Python content was freely available on YouTube through SariqDev.

That discovery shifted something in me. I realized many educational centers had turned learning into business. It became clear that without English, a person could not develop seriously. So I joined offline courses — not one, but nearly ten different learning centers — staying no more than 2.5 months at each because I was dissatisfied with progress, environment, or cost. No center gave me the energy, focus, or pressure that my lyceum days had given me. I understood that true results were coming from my own attempts, not from institutions.

That realization pushed me toward full self-study. My plan became simple: learn English well enough to open the gates to all other knowledge. Those months felt like wandering — like a lost ant trying to find its destiny — filled with valuable experiences that came at the cost of precious time.

During this period, I learned Django and backend development, but another issue arose: backend work was invisible. Even my parents could not see what I was doing, and IT was something completely new in the countryside. That made me decide to become a full-stack developer. I learned JavaScript, React, Redux, and even touched mobile development through React Native and Expo. I worked intensely, but my English remained a bottleneck.

In 2024, I finally reached the level where I could study English-language resources directly. Time then became my tightest constraint. Around this period, I also began listening to English Islamic lectures, especially from Nouman Ali Khan. This strengthened my comprehension, and it felt natural because Islam was already familiar to me. Along with that, I held a personal principle: to learn languages without adopting the behaviors or moral patterns of their cultures, so that I would not lose my own identity in the process.

In November 2024, I joined Velo Ijara, a small bike rental company in Tashkent, not just as a practical trainee but as the lead developer within the trainee framework. I worked there for eight months, handling the technical side while gaining real-world experience in a small but active environment.

Recently, I revisited electronics through YouTube lessons. Suddenly, the advanced physics theories I had learned in the lyceum connected with the physical devices I had never seen closely before. That combination gave me new hope of returning to this field someday.

I believe that if God permits, I can learn and do anything. But I also know my nature: I dive deeply into new subjects, absorb them fully, and then often feel overwhelmed by the amount of work needed to bring the ideas to life. Time, budget, and resources intimidate me. I do not think I will feel fulfilled working only as a regular employee; I am drawn toward craft, design, and invention. The conditions around me may not support these ambitions, but I still care about them. I share my ideas and paths not for fame, but because I want to see those ideas come alive in the real world, even if through someone else’s hands.
